      <p class="p1">It was the first game I played when I got my laptop and
         I fell in love with it where the gameplay was phenomenal and the graphics were outstanding.</p>
      <p class="p2">The story of the game was intense and detailed showing how much time they took in it.</p>
      <p class="p3">Finally, the main character had conflicts that made the game very enjoyable.</p>
