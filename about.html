    <p class="p4">Jin Sakai from Ghost of Tsushima. I admire him because he represents strength, 
      honor, and personal growth. Jin starts as a traditional samurai who strictly follows the code of honor, 
      but as his island is invaded, he’s forced to question everything he was taught. 
      I like him because he’s willing to change and make hard choices to protect his people, even if it means going against what he was 
      raised to believe. His story is about sacrifice, loyalty, and becoming your own person—and that’s what makes him so powerful and 
      inspiring to me.
